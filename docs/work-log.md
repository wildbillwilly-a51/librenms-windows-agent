- Promoted overlay package 0.6.0 and Windows MSI from development commit 1eec530 with checksums be12a173d842d5f0b51be5c11badec2ef89d6d5477beb2585e32f6f71ef9054a and de92c2ab32a0077782c3b40b956632781e4bfcdad8c070dd8b9e4b3c6a8c4ced. Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.0 from development commit eedf0df with checksum b45e5be3314964dd62909bc085557ba13b4b4386ffca3318bcc5d65eb96a5234. Validation: generated package tar listing, checksum update, and legacy-branding scan passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Created the public generic LibreNMS Windows Agent installer repository with a
  one-command server-side overlay installer and checksum-pinned release payload.
- Added local-first project workflow files so this local Git repo is the
  primary project record and GitHub remains the sanitized public distribution
  mirror.
- Added full project documentation for opening this folder as its own Codex
  project, including current state, read order, release runbook, and upstream
  sync model.
- Added `scripts/promote-from-dev-overlay.ps1` as the official interim
  promotion path from the private development overlay package to the public
  generic installer package.
- Updated the installer workflow so promotion into this repo is the review
  boundary and successful local installer commits automatically push to GitHub.
- Validation: installer syntax, tarball listing, checksum generation, raw
  GitHub URL checks, and legacy-branding scan were run during initial
  publication. PHP lint was skipped because PHP is not installed locally.
